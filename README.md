Last Status Issued contains one byte identifying what the last known status message sent from the terminal was (other than download-type messages). It does not necessarily relate to the Transaction Serial Number. The value will be one of the following: '0' - none sent; '1' - good termination sent; '2' - error status sent; '3' - transaction reply rejected. If Option 76 is set to 000 (four cassette types), Last Transaction Notes Dispensed contains four five-digit decimal counts defining the notes dispensed on the last transaction if the last function command received and processed was a dispense command. These counts will be zero if the last function command received and processed was not a dispense command. If Option 76 is set to 001 (seven cassette types), Last Transaction Notes Dispensed contains seven five-digit decimal counts defining the notes dispensed on the last transaction if the last function command received and processed was a dispense command. These counts will be zero if the last function command received and processed was not a dispense command. The Last Transaction Coinage Amount Dispensed field is included for migration purposes only and always contains zeros. If a Coin Dispenser is present and Option 79 is set to 000 (four hopper types), the Last Transaction Coins Dispensed contains four five-digit decimal counts defining the coins dispensed from each hopper on the last dispense transaction. These will be zero if the last function command was not a coin dispense type function, or if this is the first transaction after installation. If a Coin Dispenser is present and Option 79 is set to 001 (more than four hopper types), this field is set to '00000'. In this case, the Last Transaction Coinage Amount Dispensed is provided in fields to cf&lt;n+1&gt;. If a Coin Dispenser is not present, this field is set to '00000'. The Last Cash Deposit Transaction Direction is present if a BNA or GBXX is present and contains 1 byte as follows: '0' - last transaction was not a cash deposit; '1' - vault direction; '2' - refund direction." check="true" classification="ATM"/>

This flag indicates that printing takes place on the reverse of a cheque and relates to cheque endorsement. This flag is not actioned if the cheque is ejected.
